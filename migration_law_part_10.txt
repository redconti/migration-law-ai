(a) 
an entry application for a designated person has been refused; and

197AB Minister may determine that person is to reside at a specified place rather than being held in detention centre etc. 
(1) 
If the Minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so, the Minister may make a determination (a residence determination) to the effect that one or more specified persons to whom this Subdivision applies are to reside at a specified place, instead of being detained at a place covered by the definition of immigration detention in subsection 5(1). 

(2)

(a) 
does not apply for the purposes of section 197 or 197A, or any of sections 252AA to 252E; and

(4) 
If: 

(a) 
a residence determination is in force in relation to a person; and 

(b) 
a provision of this Act requires the person to be released from immigration detention, or this Act no longer requires or permits the person to be detained; 


then, at the time when paragraph (b) becomes satisfied, the residence determination, so far as it covers the person, is revoked by force of this subsection and the person is, by that revocation, released from immigration detention. 
Note: Because the residence determination is revoked, the person is no longer subject to the conditions specified in the determination.

Note 2: If the Minister revokes a residence determination (without making a replacement determination) and a person covered by the determination is a person whom section 189 requires to be detained, the person will then have to be taken into detention at a place that is covered by the definition of immigration detention in subsection 5(1). 
(2)

(3) 
Despite subsections (1) and (2), section 198 does not require or authorise an officer to remove an unlawful non-citizen to a country if: 

(a) 
the non-citizen has made a valid application for a protection visa that has been finally determined; and 

(b) 
in the course of considering the application, a protection finding within the meaning of subsection (4), (5), (6) or (7) was made for the non-citizen with respect to the country (whether or not the visa was refused or was granted and has since been cancelled); and 

(c) 
none of the following apply: 

(i)

(5) 
A protection finding is also made for a non-citizen with respect to a country if the Minister was satisfied of any of the following (however expressed and including impliedly):

satisfied the criterion in subsection 36(1C); 

(d) 
the non-citizen: 

(i) 
satisfied the criterion in paragraph 36(2)(a) with respect to the country but did not satisfy the criterion in subsection 36(1C); and

(a) 
the non-citizen is: 

(i) 
an unlawful non-citizen; or 

(ii) 
a removal pathway non-citizen covered by paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of the definition of that expression in subsection 5(1); and

(2) 
If the Minister is satisfied that the non-citizen is no longer a person in respect of whom any protection finding within the meaning of subsection 197C(4), (5), (6) or (7) would be made, the Minister may make a decision to that effect. 


(2A) A decision made under subsection (2) is a decision of a kind referred to in subparagraph 197C(3)(c)(ii), whether it is made in relation to:

(1) 
For the purposes of section 198, it is irrelevant whether the Minister has been requested to exercise, or consider exercising, a Ministerial intervention power in relation to an unlawful non-citizen. 

(2) 
To avoid doubt: 

(a) 
an officers duty to remove as soon as reasonably practicable an unlawful non-citizen under section 198 arises irrespective of whether the Minister has been requested to exercise, or consider exercising, a Ministerial intervention power in relation to the unlawful non-citizen; and 

(b) 
the fact that the Minister has been requested to exercise, or consider exercising, a Ministerial intervention power in relation to an unlawful non-citizen is irrelevant to whether or not the removal of the unlawful non-citizen is reasonably practicable for the purposes of section 198. 


Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 8  Removal of unlawful non-citizens etc. 
Section 197E 
(3) 
Subsection (1) applies whether a request is made by: 

(a) 
the unlawful non-citizen; or 

(b) 
an officer of the Department; or 

(c) 
any other person. 

(4) 
Subsection (1) applies whether or not a request has been drawn to the Ministers attention. 


Temporary suspension of duty to remove unlawful non-citizens 
(5) Despite subsection (1), if the Minister decides to consider whether to exercise a Ministerial intervention power (whether on request or otherwise) in relation to an unlawful non-citizen, section 198 does not require or authorise an officer to remove the non-citizen from Australia during the period covered by subsection (6). 
Note: Despite this subsection, an unlawful non-citizen who asks the Minister, in writing, to be removed, must be removed under subsection 198(1) (see subsection (11) of this section). 
Period during which duty to remove is suspended 
(6) 
For the purposes of subsection (5), the period is 6 months starting on the day (the start day) the Minister decides to consider whether to exercise the Ministerial intervention power in relation to the unlawful non-citizen, unless: 

(a) 
before the end of that 6 month period, the unlawful non-citizen has agreed, in writing, to a day occurring after the end of that 6 month period nominated, in writing, by the Ministerin which case the period ends on the agreed day (subject to paragraph (b)); or 

(b) 
the period ends earlier under subsection (7). 

(7) 
For the purposes of paragraph (6)(b), the period ends at the earliest of the following times: 

(a) 
the end of the day the Minister decides not to exercise the Ministerial intervention power in relation to the unlawful non-citizen; 


Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Removal of unlawful non-citizens etc. Division 8 
Section 197E 
(b) 
the end of the day the Minister decides to stop considering whether to exercise the power in relation to the non-citizen; 

(c) 
if the Minister exercises the power in relation to the non-citizen, and subsection (8) specifies a daythe end of that day; 

(d) 
if the Minister exercises the power in relation to the non-citizen but the exercise does not result in the non-citizen being able to make a visa applicationthe end of the day that the Minister exercises the power. 

(8) 
For the purposes of paragraph (7)(c), this subsection specifies the following days: 

(a) 
in a case where, as a consequence of the exercise of the Ministerial intervention power, the unlawful non-citizen may make a visa application within a specified periodthe last day of the period in which the non-citizen could make the visa application; 

(b) 
in any other case where, as a consequence of the exercise of the power, the non-citizen may make a visa application whichever of the following days occurs first: 

(i) 
the last day of the period determined by the Minister in which the non-citizen could make the visa application; 

(ii) 
the day that is 3 months after the Minister exercises the power. 


Working out start day for certain requests 
(9) 
If the Minister decides to consider whether to exercise a Ministerial intervention power in relation to a particular category of requests for such exercise by unlawful non-citizens, then, for the purposes of subsection (6), the start day, in relation to a particular unlawful non-citizen, is the day that the non-citizens request is received, in writing, by the Minister. 

(10) 
To avoid doubt, subsection (5) of this section: 


Scope of suspension of duty to remove unlawful non-citizen 
Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 8  Removal of unlawful non-citizens etc. 
Section 198 
(a) 
prevents the removal of an unlawful non-citizen during the period covered by subsection (6); but 

(b) 
does not prevent any other action being taken, or thing being done, during that period to facilitate or otherwise prepare for the eventual removal of the non-citizen after the period ends. 


Example: The Minister could give the unlawful non-citizen a removal pathway direction under section 199C during the period covered by subsection (6). 
Unlawful non-citizen must be removed at non-citizens request 
(11) Despite subsection (5), an officer is required and authorised to remove an unlawful non-citizen who asks the Minister, in writing, to be so removed under subsection 198(1). 
198 Removal from Australia of unlawful non-citizens 
Removal on request 
(1) An officer must remove as soon as reasonably practicable an unlawful non-citizen who asks the Minister, in writing, to be so removed. 
Removal of transitory persons brought to Australia for a 
temporary purpose 
(1A) In the case of an unlawful non-citizen who has been brought to Australia under section 198B or repealed section 198C for a temporary purpose, an officer must remove the person as soon as reasonably practicable after the person no longer needs to be in Australia for that purpose (whether or not the purpose has been achieved). 
Note 1: Some unlawful non-citizens are transitory persons. Section 198B provides for transitory persons to be brought to Australia for a temporary purpose. See the definition of transitory person in subsection 5(1). 
Note 2: Section 198C was repealed by the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Act 2019. It provided for certain transitory persons

Section 198 
to be brought to Australia for a temporary purpose (including the temporary purpose of medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment). 
(1B) Subsection (1C) applies if: 
(a) 
an unlawful non-citizen who is not an unauthorised maritime arrival has been brought to Australia under section 198B or repealed section 198C for a temporary purpose; and

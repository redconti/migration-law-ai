Subdivision BRegional processing 
198AA Reason for Subdivision

(c) 
it is a matter for the Minister and Parliament to decide which countries should be designated as regional processing countries; and 

(d) 
the designation of a country to be a regional processing country need not be determined by reference to the international obligations or domestic law of that country.

a copy of the designation has been laid before each House of the Parliament under section 198AC; 

(ii) 
5 sitting days of each House have passed since the copy was laid before that House without it passing a resolution disapproving the designation. 

(2) 
The only condition for the exercise of the power under subsection (1) is that the Minister thinks that it is in the national interest to designate the country to be a regional processing country. 

(3) 
In considering the national interest for the purposes of subsection (2), the Minister: 

(a) 
must have regard to whether or not the country has given Australia any assurances to the effect that: 

(i) 
the country will not expel or return a person taken to the country under section 198AD to another country where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion; and 

(ii) 
the country will make an assessment, or permit an assessment to be made, of whether or not a person taken to the country under that section is covered by the definition of refugee in Article 1A of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; and 

(b) 
may have regard to any other matter which, in the opinion of the Minister, relates to the national interest. 

(4) 
The assurances referred to in paragraph (3)(a) need not be legally binding. 

(5) 
The power under subsection (1) may only be exercised by the Minister personally. 

(6)

(b)

(5) 
A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the designation.

(a) 
whether or not it is legally binding; and 

(b)

(c) 
do anything else that is incidental or conducive to the taking of such action or the making of such payments. 


Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Removal of unlawful non-citizens etc. Division 8 
Section 198AHC 
(3) 
To avoid doubt, subsection (2) is intended to ensure that the Commonwealth has capacity and authority to take action, without otherwise affecting the lawfulness of that action. 

(4) 
Nothing in this section limits: 

(a) 
any other power or duty under this Act; or 

(b) 
the executive power of the Commonwealth. 

(5) 
In this section: 


action includes action in a foreign country. 
arrangement includes an arrangement, agreement, understanding, promise or undertaking, whether or not it is legally binding. 
third country reception functions, of a foreign country, means the implementation of any law or policy, or the taking of any action, by that country (including, if the foreign country so decides, exercising restraint over the liberty of a person) in connection with the role of that country as a country which has agreed to the acceptance, receipt or ongoing presence of persons who are not citizens of that country, whether the implementation or the taking of action occurs in that country or another country. 
198AHC Relevance of Ministerial intervention powers to transfer of unauthorised maritime arrivals 
(1) 
For the purposes of subsection 198AD(2), it is irrelevant whether the Minister has been requested to exercise, or consider exercising, a Ministerial intervention power in relation to an unauthorised maritime arrival. 

(2) 
To avoid doubt: 

(a) 
an officers duty to take, as soon as reasonably practicable, an unauthorised maritime arrival from Australia to a regional processing country under subsection 198AD(2) arises irrespective of whether the Minister has been requested to exercise, or consider exercising, a Ministerial intervention power in relation to the unauthorised maritime arrival; and 


Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 8  Removal of unlawful non-citizens etc. 
Section 198AHC 
(b) 
the fact that the Minister has been requested to exercise, or consider exercising, a Ministerial intervention power in relation to an unauthorised maritime arrival is irrelevant to whether or not the taking of the unauthorised maritime arrival from Australia to a regional processing country is reasonably practicable for the purposes of subsection 198AD(2). 

(3) 
Subsection (1) applies whether a request is made by: 

(a) 
the unauthorised maritime arrival; or 

(b) 
an officer of the Department; or 

(c) 
any other person. 

(4) 
Subsection (1) applies whether or not a request has been drawn to the Ministers attention. 


Temporary suspension of duty to transfer unauthorised maritime arrivals 
(5) Despite subsection (1), if the Minister decides to consider whether to exercise a Ministerial intervention power (whether on request or otherwise) in relation to an unauthorised maritime arrival, subsection 198AD(2) does not require or authorise an officer to take the unauthorised maritime arrival from Australia to a regional processing country during the period covered by subsection (6). 
Note: Despite this subsection, an unauthorised maritime arrival who asks the Minister, in writing, to be taken from Australia to a regional processing country must be taken to that country (see subsection (10)). 
Period during which duty to transfer is suspended 
(6) 
For the purposes of subsection (5), the period is 6 months starting on the day (the start day) the Minister decides to consider whether to exercise the Ministerial intervention power in relation to the unauthorised maritime arrival, unless: 

(a) 
before the end of that 6 month period, the unauthorised maritime arrival has agreed, in writing, to a day occurring after the end of that 6 month period nominated, in writing, by 


Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Removal of unlawful non-citizens etc. Division 8 
Section 198AHC 
the Ministerin which case the period ends on the agreed day (subject to paragraph (b)); or 
(b) 
the period ends earlier under subsection (7). 

(7) 
For the purposes of paragraph (6)(b), the period ends at the earliest of the following times: 

(a) 
the end of the day the Minister decides not to exercise the power in relation to the unauthorised maritime arrival; 

(b) 
the end of the day the Minister decides to stop considering whether to exercise the power in relation to the unauthorised maritime arrival; 

(c) 
if the Minister exercises the power in relation to the unauthorised maritime arrival, and subsection (8) specifies a daythe end of that day; 

(d) 
if the Minister exercises the power in relation to the unauthorised maritime arrival but the exercise does not result in the unauthorised maritime arrival being able to make a visa applicationthe end of the day that the Minister exercises the power. 

(8) 
For the purposes of paragraph (7)(c), this subsection specifies the following days: 

(a) 
in a case where, as a consequence of the exercise of the Ministerial intervention power, the unauthorised maritime arrival may make a visa application within a specified periodthe last day of the period in which the unauthorised maritime arrival could make the visa application; 

(b) 
in any other case where, as a consequence of the exercise of the power, the unauthorised maritime arrival may make a visa applicationwhichever of the following days occurs first: 

(i) 
the last day of the period determined by the Minister in which the unauthorised maritime arrival could make the visa application; 

(ii) 
the day that is 3 months after the Minister exercises the power.

Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 8  Removal of unlawful non-citizens etc. 
Section 198AI 
Scope of suspension of duty to transfer unauthorised maritime arrival 
(9) 
To avoid doubt, subsection (5) of this section: 

(a) 
prevents an unauthorised maritime arrival being taken from Australia to a regional processing country during the period covered by subsection (6); but 

(b) 
does not prevent any other action being taken, or thing being done, during that period to facilitate or otherwise prepare for the unauthorised maritime arrival being taken from Australia to a regional processing country after the period ends. 


Unauthorised maritime arrival may request transfer to regional processing country 
(10) Despite subsection (5), if an unauthorised maritime arrival to whom section 198AD applies asks the Minister, in writing, to be taken from Australia to a regional processing country under section 198AD, the unauthorised maritime arrival must be taken, under that section, to that country. 
198AI Ministerial report 
The Minister must, as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year, cause to be laid before each House of Parliament a report setting out: 
(a) 
the activities conducted under the Bali Process during the year ending on 30 June; and 

(b)

(b) 
may commit the offence of refusing or failing to comply with the direction under section 199E. 


Note: For the circumstances in which the Minister must not give a removal pathway direction, see section 199D. 
(3) To avoid doubt, nothing in section 199C or 199D authorises or requires the removal of an unlawful non-citizen under section 198 to a country to which the non-citizen could not be removed because of subsection 197C(3). 
199C Minister may give removal pathway directions

report in person to an officer or another person in accordance with instructions specified in the direction. 

(2)

Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 8  Removal of unlawful non-citizens etc. 
Section 199D 
Interaction with monitoring conditions on certain bridging visas 
(6) To avoid doubt, if a removal pathway non-citizen covered by paragraph (b) of the definition of that expression in subsection 5(1) refuses or fails to comply with a removal pathway direction, the refusal or failure does not constitute a failure to comply with a requirement of a monitoring condition (within the meaning of subsection 76B(4)) for the purposes of paragraph 76B(1)(d). 
Multiple and concurrent directions 
(7) 
A non-citizen may be given more than one removal pathway direction.

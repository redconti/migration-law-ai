Subdivision BOffences relating to abuse of laws allowing spouses etc. of Australian citizens or of permanent residents to become permanent residents 
237 Reason for Subdivision 
This Subdivision was enacted because: 
(a) 
under the regulations, a person satisfies a criterion for certain visas that give, or might lead to, authorisation for the persons permanent residence in Australia if the person is the spouse or de facto partner of, and has a genuine and continuing relationship, involving a shared life to the exclusion of all others with, either an Australian citizen or a permanent resident of Australia; and 

(c) 
some persons attempt to get permanent residence under the regulations by: 

(i) 
entering into a married relationship that is not intended to be a genuine and continuing relationship involving a shared life to the exclusion of all others; or 

(ii) 
pretending to be a de facto partner of another person. 


238 Interpretation 
In this Subdivision: 
criterion includes part of a criterion. 
preliminary visa, means a visa that is usually applied for by persons applying, or intending to apply, for a permanent visa. 
stay visa means: 
(a) a permanent visa; or

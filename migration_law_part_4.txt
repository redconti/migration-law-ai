1(1) may prescribe additional classes of permanent and temporary visas as protection visas. 

(5) 
A class of visas that was formerly provided for by subsection 36(1), as that subsection was in force before the commencement of this section, is also a class of protection visas for the purposes of this Act and the regulations. 


Example: An example of a class of visas for subsection (5) is the class of visas formerly classified by the Migration Regulations 1994 as Protection (Class AZ) visas. These visas can no longer be granted. 
Note: This section commenced, and subsection 36(1) was repealed, on the commencement of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014. 
(6) 
The criteria for a class of protection visas are: 

(a) 
the criteria set out in section 36; and 

(b) 
any other relevant criteria prescribed by regulation for the purposes of section 31. 


Note: See also Subdivision AL. 
36 Protection visascriteria provided for by this Act 
(1A) An applicant for a protection visa must satisfy: 
(a) 
both of the criteria in subsections (1B) and (1C); and 

(b) 
at least one of the criteria in subsection (2). 


Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Visas for non-citizens  Division 3 
Section 36 
(1B) A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant is not assessed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to be directly or indirectly a risk to security (within the meaning of section 4 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979). 
(1C) A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant is not a person whom the Minister considers, on reasonable grounds: 
(a) 
is a danger to Australias security; or 

(b) 
having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, is a danger to the Australian community. 


Note: For paragraph (b), see section 5M. 
(2) 
A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is: 

(a) 
a non-citizen in Australia in respect of whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations because the person is a refugee; or 


(aa) a non-citizen in Australia (other than a non-citizen mentioned in paragraph (a)) in respect of whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations because the Minister has substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the non-citizen being removed from Australia to a receiving country, there is a real risk that the non-citizen will suffer significant harm; or 
(b) 
a non-citizen in Australia who is a member of the same family unit as a non-citizen who: 

(i) 
is mentioned in paragraph (a); and 

(ii) 
holds a protection visa of the same class as that applied for by the applicant; or 

(c) 
a non-citizen in Australia who is a member of the same family unit as a non-citizen who: 

(i) 
is mentioned in paragraph (aa); and 

(ii) 
holds a protection visa of the same class as that applied for by the applicant. 


(2A) A non-citizen will suffer significant harm if: 
(a) the non-citizen will be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life; or 
Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 36 
(b) 
the death penalty will be carried out on the non-citizen; or 

(c) 
the non-citizen will be subjected to torture; or 

(d) 
the non-citizen will be subjected to cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment; or 

(e) 
the non-citizen will be subjected to degrading treatment or punishment. 


(2B) However, there is taken not to be a real risk that a non-citizen will suffer significant harm in a country if the Minister is satisfied that: 
(a) 
it would be reasonable for the non-citizen to relocate to an area of the country where there would not be a real risk that the non-citizen will suffer significant harm; or 

(b) 
the non-citizen could obtain, from an authority of the country, protection such that there would not be a real risk that the non-citizen will suffer significant harm; or 

(c) 
the real risk is one faced by the population of the country generally and is not faced by the non-citizen personally. 


Ineligibility for grant of a protection visa 
(2C) A non-citizen is taken not to satisfy the criterion mentioned in paragraph (2)(aa) if: 
(a) 
the Minister has serious reasons for considering that: 

(i) 
the non-citizen has committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, as defined by international instruments prescribed by the regulations; or 

(ii) 
the non-citizen committed a serious non-political crime before entering Australia; or 


(iii) the non-citizen has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations; or 
(b) 
the Minister considers, on reasonable grounds, that: 

(i) 
the non-citizen is a danger to Australias security; or 

(ii) 
the non-citizen, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime (including a crime that consists of the commission of a serious 


Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Visas for non-citizens  Division 3 
Section 36 
Australian offence or serious foreign offence), is a danger to the Australian community. 
Protection obligations 
(3) 
Australia is taken not to have protection obligations in respect of a non-citizen who has not taken all possible steps to avail himself or herself of a right to enter and reside in, whether temporarily or permanently and however that right arose or is expressed, any country apart from Australia, including countries of which the non-citizen is a national. 

(4) 
However, subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a country in respect of which: 

(a) 
the non-citizen has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion; or 

(b) 
the Minister has substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the non-citizen availing himself or herself of a right mentioned in subsection (3), there would be a real risk that the non-citizen will suffer significant harm in relation to the country. 

(5) 
Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a country if the non-citizen has a well-founded fear that: 

(a) 
the country will return the non-citizen to another country; and 

(b) 
the non-citizen will be persecuted in that other country for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. 


(5A) Also, subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a country if: 
(a) 
the non-citizen has a well-founded fear that the country will return the non-citizen to another country; and 

(b) 
the Minister has substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the non-citizen availing himself or herself of a right mentioned in 


Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 36A 
subsection (3), there would be a real risk that the non-citizen will suffer significant harm in relation to the other country. 
Determining nationality 
(6) 
For the purposes of subsection (3), the question of whether a non-citizen is a national of a particular country must be determined solely by reference to the law of that country. 

(7) 
Subsection (6) does not, by implication, affect the interpretation of any other provision of this Act. 


36A Consideration of protection obligations 
(1) 
In considering a valid application for a protection visa made by a non-citizen, the Minister must consider and make a record of whether the Minister is satisfied of any of the following: 

(a) 
the non-citizen satisfies the criterion in paragraph 36(2)(a) with respect to a country and also satisfies the criterion in subsection 36(1C); 

(b) 
the non-citizen satisfies the criterion in paragraph 36(2)(aa) with respect to a country; 

(c) 
the non-citizen: 

(i) 
satisfies the criterion in paragraph 36(2)(a) with respect to a country but does not satisfy the criterion in subsection 36(1C); and 

(ii) 
would satisfy the criterion in paragraph 36(2)(aa) with respect to a country except that the non-citizen is a non-citizen mentioned in paragraph 36(2)(a). 

(2) 
The Minister must do so: 

(a) 
before deciding whether to grant or refuse to grant the visa; and 

(b) 
before considering whether the non-citizen satisfies any other criteria for the grant of the visa; and 

(c) 
before considering whether the grant of the visa is prevented by any provision of the Act or regulations; and 

(d) 
without regard to subsections 36(2C) and (3). 


Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Visas for non-citizens  Division 3 
Section 37 
(3) 
Subsection (1) does not apply if: 

(a) 
the non-citizen (the family applicant) is a member of the same family unit as another non-citizen (the family visa holder) who holds a protection visa of the same class as the visa the family applicant is applying for; and 

(b) 
the family applicants application for a protection visa was made before the family visa holder was granted their visa; and 

(c) 
the family visa holder is a non-citizen mentioned in paragraph 36(2)(a) or (aa). 


37 Bridging visas 
There are classes of temporary visas, to be known as bridging visas, to be granted under Subdivision AF. 
37A Temporary safe haven visas 
(1) There is a class of temporary visas to travel to, enter and remain in Australia, to be known as temporary safe haven visas. 
Note: A temporary safe haven visa is granted to a person to give the person temporary safe haven in Australia. 
(2) 
The Minister may, by notice in the Gazette, extend the visa period of a temporary safe haven visa so that the visa ceases to be in effect on the day specified in the notice. 

(3) 
The Minister may, by notice in the Gazette, shorten the visa period of a temporary safe haven visa so that the visa ceases to be in effect on the day specified in the notice if, in the Ministers opinion, temporary safe haven in Australia is no longer necessary for the holder of the visa because of changes of a fundamental, durable and stable nature in the country concerned. 

(4) 
If a notice under subsection (3) is published in the Gazette, the Minister must cause a copy of the notice to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 3 sitting days of that House after the publication of the notice, together with a statement that sets out 


Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 38 
the reasons for the notice, referring in particular to the Ministers reasons for thinking that changes of a fundamental, durable and stable nature have occurred in the country concerned. 
(5) 
If a notice under subsection (2) or (3) is published in the Gazette and has not been revoked, then the visa ceases to be in effect on the day specified in the notice, despite any other provision of this Act. 

(6) 
The Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (2) in respect of any non-citizen, whether he or she is requested to do so by the non-citizen or by any other person, or in any other circumstances. 

(7) 
In this section: 


country concerned means the country or countries in which the circumstances exist that give rise to the grant of temporary safe haven visas. 
38 Criminal justice visas

There is a class of temporary visas to travel to and enter Australia by sea, and to remain in Australia, to be known as maritime crew visas. 

(2) 
Subject to subsection 43(1B), a maritime crew visa held by a non-citizen does not grant the non-citizen permission to travel to or enter Australia by air. 


Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Visas for non-citizens  Division 3 
Section 39 
Note: However, a non-citizen might also hold another class of visa that allows the non-citizen to travel to and enter Australia by air. 
(3) 
The Minister may make a written declaration, for the purposes of this section, that it is undesirable that a person, or any persons in a class of persons, travel to and enter Australia, or remain in Australia. 

(4) 
If the Minister makes a declaration under subsection (3) in relation to a person, or a class of persons of which a person is a member, a maritime crew visa held by that person ceases to be in effect: 

(a) 
if the Minister specifies a time in the declaration (which must be after the time when the declaration is made) as the time the declaration takes effectat the time so specified; or 

(b) 
if the Minister does not specify such a time in the declarationat the end of the day on which the declaration is made. 


Note: A maritime crew visa can also cease to be in effect under other sections (see for example section 82). 
(5) If the Minister revokes a declaration made under subsection (4), the Minister is taken never to have made the declaration. 
Note: Under subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Minister may revoke a declaration made under subsection (4). 
(6) 
Despite subsection (5), any detention of the non-citizen that occurred during any part of the period: 

(a) 
beginning when the Minister made the declaration; and 

(b) 
ending at the time of the revocation of the declaration; is lawful and the non-citizen is not entitled to make any claim 


against the Commonwealth, an officer or any other person because of the detention. 
39 Criterion limiting number of visas 
(1) In spite of section 14 of the Legislation Act 2003, a prescribed criterion for visas of a class, other than protection visas, may be the criterion that the grant of the visa would not cause the number of visas of that class granted in a particular financial year to exceed 
Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 39A 
whatever number is fixed by the Minister, by legislative instrument, as the maximum number of such visas that may be granted in that year (however the criterion is expressed). 
(2) For the purposes of this Act, when a criterion allowed by subsection (1) prevents the grant in a financial year of any more visas of a particular class, any outstanding applications for the grant in that year of visas of that class are taken not to have been made. 
39A Minimum annual numbers of Protection (Class XA) visas and Refugee and Humanitarian (Class XB) visas 
(1) 
Despite any legislative instrument made for the purposes of section 39, the Minister must take all reasonably practicable measures to ensure the grant in a financial year of at least the minimum total number of Protection (Class XA) visas and Refugee and Humanitarian (Class XB) visas that is determined by the Minister under subsection (3) of this section for that year. 

(2) 
Subsection (1) applies subject to this Act, and to any regulation or instrument made under or for the purposes of this Act (other than section 39 of this Act). 

(3) 
The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine a minimum total number of Protection (Class XA) visas and Refugee and Humanitarian (Class XB) visas for a financial year specified in the determination. 

(4) 
Despite regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 44(2)(b) of the Legislation Act 2003, section 42 (disallowance) of that Act applies to a legislative instrument made under subsection (3) of this section. 

(5) 
In this section:

(a) 
at a port; or

(b) 
if the health or safety of a person, or a prescribed reason, make it necessary to enter Australia in another way, that way; or 

(c)

45 Application for visa 
(1) Subject to this Act and the regulations, a non-citizen who wants a visa must apply for a visa of a particular class. 
45AA Application for one visa taken to be an application for a different visa 
Situation in which conversion regulation can be made 
(1) 
This section applies if: 

(a) 
a person has made a valid application (a pre-conversion application) for a visa (a pre-conversion visa) of a particular class; and 

(b) 
the pre-conversion visa has not been granted to the person, whether or not a migration decision has been made in relation to the pre-conversion application; and 

(c) 
since the application was made, one or more of the following events has occurred: 

(i) 
the requirements for making a valid application for that class of visa change; 

(ii) 
the criteria for the grant of that class of visa change; 


(iii) that class of visa ceases to exist; and 
(d) 
had the application been made after the event (or events) occurred, because of that event (or those events): 

(i) 
the application would not have been valid; or 

(ii) 
that class of visa could not have been granted to the person. 

(2) 
To avoid doubt, under subsection (1) this section may apply in relation to: 


Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 45AA 
(a) 
classes of visas, including protection visas and any other classes of visas provided for by this Act or the regulations; and 

(b) 
classes of applicants, including applicants having a particular status; and 

(c) 
applicants for a visa who are taken to have applied for the visa by the operation of this Act or the regulations. 


Example:If a non-citizen applies for a visa, and then, before the application is decided, gives birth to a child, in some circumstances the child is taken, by the operation of the regulations, to have applied for a visa of the same class at the time the child is born (see regulation 2.08). 
Conversion regulation 
(3) 
For the purposes of this Act, a regulation (a conversion regulation) may provide that, despite anything else in this Act, the pre-conversion application for the pre-conversion visa: 

(a) 
is taken not to be, and never to have been, a valid application for the pre-conversion visa; and 

(b) 
is taken to be, and always to have been, a valid application (a converted application) for a visa of a different class (specified by the conversion regulation) made by the applicant for the pre-conversion visa. 


Note: This section may apply in relation to a pre-conversion application made before the commencement of the section (see the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014). 
For example, a conversion regulation (made after the commencement of this section) could have the effect that a pre-conversion application for a particular type of visa made on 1 August 2014 (before that commencement): 
(a) 
is taken not to have been made on 1 August 2014 (or ever); and 

(b) 
is taken to be, and always to have been, a converted application for another type of visa made on 1 August 2014. 

(4) 
Without limiting subsection (3), a conversion regulation may: 

(a) 
prescribe a class or classes of pre-conversion visas; and 

(b) 
prescribe a class of applicants for pre-conversion visas; and 


Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Visas for non-citizens  Division 3 
Section 45AA 
(c) prescribe a time (the conversion time) when the regulation is to start to apply in relation to a pre-conversion application, including different conversion times depending on the occurrence of different events. 
Visa application charge 
(5) 
If an amount has been paid as the first instalment of the visa application charge for a pre-conversion application, then, at and after the conversion time in relation to the application: 

(a) 
that payment is taken not to have been paid as the first instalment of the visa application charge for the pre-conversion application; and 

(b) 
that payment is taken to be payment of the first instalment of the visa application charge for the converted application, even if the first instalment of the visa application charge that would otherwise be payable for the converted application is greater than the actual amount paid for the first instalment of the visa application charge for the pre-conversion application; and 

(c) 
in a case in which the first instalment of the visa application charge payable for the converted application is less than the actual amount paid for the first instalment of the visa application charge for the pre-conversion application, no refund is payable in respect of the difference only for that reason. 


Note: For the visa application charge, see sections 45A, 45B and 45C. 
Effect on bridging visas 
(6) For the purposes of this Act, if, immediately before the conversion time for a pre-conversion application, a person held a bridging visa because the pre-conversion application had not been finally determined, then, at and after the conversion time, the bridging visa has effect as if it had been granted because of the converted application. 
Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 45A 
(7) 
For the purposes of this Act, if, immediately before the conversion time for a pre-conversion application, a person had made an application for a bridging visa because of the pre-conversion application, but the bridging visa application had not been finally determined, then, at and after the conversion time: 

(a) 
the bridging visa application is taken to have been applied for because of the converted application; and 

(b) 
the bridging visa (if granted) has effect as if it were granted because of the converted application. 


Note: This Act and the regulations would apply to a bridging visa to which subsection (6) or (7) applies, and to when the bridging visa would cease to have effect, in the same way as this Act and the regulations would apply in relation to any bridging visa. 
For example, such a bridging visa would generally cease to be in effect under section 82 if and when the substantive visa is granted because of the converted application. 
Conversion regulation may affect accrued rights etc. 
(8) 
To avoid doubt: 

(a) 
subsection 12(2) (retrospective application of legislative instruments) of the Legislation Act 2003 does not apply in relation to the effect of a conversion regulation (including a conversion regulation enacted by the Parliament); and 

(b) 
subsection 7(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, including that subsection as applied by section 13 of the Legislation Act 2003, does not apply in relation to the enactment of this section or the making of a conversion regulation (including a conversion regulation enacted by the Parliament).

(i) 
the non-citizen does not hold any other bridging visa; or 

(ii) 
the reactivated bridging visa is determined, in accordance with the regulations, to be the most beneficial of the bridging visas held by the applicant. 

(5) 
Subsection (4) does not apply in relation to a Subclass 070 (Bridging (Removal Pending)) visa (the first visa) for a non-citizen that ceases to be in effect under subsection 82(3) if the first visa ceases to be in effect under subsection 82(3) because another Subclass 070 (Bridging (Removal Pending)) visa for the non-citizen comes into effect. 

(6) 
For the purposes of subparagraph (b)(ii) of the definition of visa period in subsection 5(1), the first visa is to be taken to have ceased to be in effect otherwise than under subsection 82(3).

69 Effect of compliance or non-compliance 
(1) 
Non-compliance by the Minister with Subdivision AA or AB or section 494D in relation to a visa application does not mean that a decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa is not a valid decision but only means that the decision might have been the wrong one and might be set aside if reviewed. 

(2) 
If the Minister deals with a visa application in a way that complies with Subdivision AA, AB and this Subdivision, the Minister is not required to take any other action in dealing with it.

(a) 
there is a determination of the maximum number of visas of a class or classes that may be granted in a financial year; and

87A Limit does not prevent the grant of visas to certain people who are unable to meet health or character requirements before the limit applies because of circumstances beyond their control 
If: 
Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Visas for non-citizens  Division 3 
Section 88 
(a) 
a person has applied, whether before or after the commencement of this section, for the grant of a visa; and 

(b) 
a time was or is reached when the grant of the visa to the person in a particular financial year was or is prevented by section 86; and 

(c) 
the person was requested by the Minister after that time to satisfy requirements for the grant of the visa that relate to health or character; and 

(d) 
after the making of the request referred to in paragraph (c) the person satisfies the requirements referred to in that paragraph in a financial year subsequent to the financial year in which the time referred to in paragraph (b) occurred; and 

(e) 
the grant of the visa to the person at the time when the requirements referred to in paragraph (c) are satisfied would, apart from this section, be prevented by section 86; and

(g) 
the Minister is satisfied that the persons inability to satisfy the requirements referred to in paragraph (c) at a time mentioned in paragraph (e) was due to circumstances beyond the persons control; 


section 86 does not prevent the grant of the visa to the person. 
88 Limit does not affect processing of applications 
Section 86s prevention of the grant of a visa does not prevent any other action related to the application for it. 
89 Determination of limit not to mean failure to decide 
The fact that the Minister has neither granted nor refused to grant a visa of a class or classes to which a determination under section 85 applies does not mean, for any purpose, that the Minister has failed to make a decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa. 
Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 90 
90 Order of dealing with limited visas 
The fact that an application for a visa of a class or classes to which a determination under section 85 applies has not been considered or disposed of although an application for another visa of the class or classes that was made later has been considered or disposed of does not mean, for any purpose, that the consideration or disposal of the earlier application is unreasonably delayed. 
91 Order of dealing with visas 
If a determination under section 85 applies, or has applied, to visas of a class or classes, the Minister may consider or, subject to section 86, dispose of outstanding and further applications for such visas in such order as he or she considers appropriate. 
Subdivision AISafe third countries 
91A Reason for Subdivision 
This Subdivision is enacted because the Parliament considers that certain non-citizens who are covered by the CPA, or in relation to whom there is a safe third country, should not be allowed to apply for a protection visa or, in some cases, any other visa. Any such non-citizen who is an unlawful non-citizen will be subject to removal under Division 8. 
91B Interpretation 
(1) In this Subdivision: 
agreement includes a written arrangement or understanding, whether or not binding. 
CPA means the Comprehensive Plan of Action approved by the International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees, held at Geneva, Switzerland, from 13 to 14 June 1989. 
Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Visas for non-citizens  Division 3 
Section 91C 
(2) 
For the purposes of this Subdivision, if, apart from this section: 

(a) 
a colony, overseas territory or protectorate of a foreign country; or 

(b) 
an overseas territory for the international relations of which a 


foreign country is responsible; is not a country in its own right, the colony, territory or protectorate is taken to be a country in its own right. 
91C Non-citizens covered by Subdivision 
(1) 
This Subdivision applies to a non-citizen at a particular time if: 

(a) 
the non-citizen is in Australia at that time; and 

(b) 
at that time, the non-citizen is covered by: 

(i) 
the CPA; or 

(ii) 
an agreement, relating to persons seeking asylum, between Australia and a country that is, or countries that include a country that is, at that time, a safe third country in relation to the non-citizen (see section 91D); and 

(c) 
the non-citizen is not excluded by the regulations from the application of this Subdivision. 

(2) 
To avoid doubt, a country does not need to be prescribed as a safe third country at the time that the agreement referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) is made. 


91D Safe third countries 
(1) 
A country is a safe third country in relation to a non-citizen if: 

(a) 
the country is prescribed as a safe third country in relation to the non-citizen, or in relation to a class of persons of which the non-citizen is a member; and 

(b) 
the non-citizen has a prescribed connection with the country. 

(2) 
Without limiting paragraph (1)(b), the regulations may provide that a person has a prescribed connection with a country if: 


Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 91E 
(a) 
the person is or was present in the country at a particular time or at any time during a particular period; or 

(b) 
the person has a right to enter and reside in the country (however that right arose or is expressed). 

(3) 
The Minister must, within 2 sitting days after a regulation under paragraph (1)(a) is laid before a House of the Parliament, cause to be laid before that House a statement, covering the country, or each of the countries, prescribed as a safe third country by the regulation, about: 

(a) 
the compliance by the country, or each of the countries, with relevant international law concerning the protection of persons seeking asylum; and 

(b) 
the meeting by the country, or each of the countries, of relevant human rights standards for the persons in relation to whom the country is prescribed as a safe third country; and 

(c) 
the willingness of the country, or each of the countries, to allow any person in relation to whom the country is prescribed as a safe third country: 

(i) 
to go to the country; and 

(ii) 
to remain in the country during the period in which any claim by the person for asylum is determined; and 


(iii) if the person is determined to be a refugee while in the countryto remain in the country until a durable solution relating to the permanent settlement of the person is found. 
(4) A regulation made for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) ceases to be in force at the end of 2 years after the regulation commences. 
91E Non-citizens to which this Subdivision applies unable to make valid applications for certain visas 
Despite any other provision of this Act, if this Subdivision applies to a non-citizen at a particular time and, at that time, the non-citizen applies, or purports to apply, for a protection visa then, subject to section 91F: 
Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Visas for non-citizens  Division 3 
Section 91F 
(a) 
if the non-citizen has not been immigration cleared at that timeneither that application nor any other application made by the non-citizen for a visa is a valid application; or 

(b) 
if the non-citizen has been immigration cleared at that time neither that application nor any other application made by the non-citizen for a protection visa is a valid application. 


91F Minister may determine that section 91E does not apply to non-citizen 
(1) 
If the Minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so, the Minister may, by written notice given to a particular non-citizen, determine: 

(a) 
that section 91E does not apply to an application for a visa made by the non-citizen in the period starting when the notice is given and ending at the end of the seventh working day after the day that the notice is given; or 

(b) 
that section 91G does not apply to an application for a visa made by the non-citizen during the transitional period referred to in that section. 

(2) 
The power under subsection (1) may only be exercised by the Minister personally. 

(3) 
If the Minister makes a determination under subsection (1), he or she is to cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament a statement that: 

(a) 
sets out the determination; and 

(b) 
sets out the reasons for the determination, referring in particular to the Ministers reasons for thinking that his or her actions are in the public interest. 

(4) 
A statement under subsection (3) is not to include: 

(a) 
the name of the non-citizen; or 

(b) 
any information that may identify the non-citizen; or 

(c) 
if the Minister thinks that it would not be in the public interest to publish the name of another person connected in 


Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 91G 
any way with the matter concernedthe name of that other person or any information that may identify that other person. 
(5) 
A statement under subsection (3) is to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after: 

(a) 
if the determination is made between 1 January and 30 June (inclusive) in a year1 July in that year; or 

(b) 
if the determination is made between 1 July and 31 December (inclusive) in a year1 January in the following year. 

(6) 
The Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any non-citizen, whether he or she is requested to do so by the non-citizen or by any other person, or in any other circumstances. 


91G Applications made before regulations take effect 
(1) 
Subject to section 91F and subsection (3), if: 

(a) 
this Subdivision applies to a non-citizen immediately after a regulation prescribing a country as a safe third country takes effect and did not apply to the non-citizen immediately before that time; and 

(b) 
the regulation prescribes a day as the cut off day; and 

(c) 
during the period (the transitional period) from the beginning of the cut off day until immediately before that regulation takes effect, the non-citizen made an application for a protection visa; 


then: 
(d) 
if the non-citizen had not been immigration cleared at the time of making the applicationthat application, and any other application made by the non-citizen for a visa made during the transitional period, ceases to be a valid application when the regulation takes effect; and 

(e) 
if the non-citizen had been immigration cleared at the time of making the applicationthat application, and any other application made by the non-citizen for a protection visa 


Migration Act 1958 
Arrival, presence and departure of persons  Part 2 Visas for non-citizens  Division 3 
Section 91H 
made during the transitional period, ceases to be a valid 
application when the regulation takes effect; and 
(f) 
on and after the regulation takes effect, this Act applies as if the non-citizen had applied for a protection visa immediately after the regulation takes effect. 

(2) 
To avoid doubt: 

(a) 
paragraphs (1)(d) and (e) apply even if an application referred to in the paragraph concerned, or a decision in relation to such an application, is the subject of a review by, or an appeal or application to, the ART, a Federal Court or any other body or court; and

(a) 
before a day on which the Minister, by notice in the Gazette, announces that he or she intends that such a regulation will be made; or 

(b) 
more than 6 months before the regulation takes effect. 


Subdivision AJTemporary safe haven visas 
91H Reason for this Subdivision

Migration Act 1958 
Part 2  Arrival, presence and departure of persons Division 3  Visas for non-citizens 
Section 91J

Note: For temporary safe haven visas, see section 37A. 
91J Non-citizens to whom this Subdivision applies

This Subdivision applies to a non-citizen in Australia at a particular time if, at that time, the non-citizen: 

(a) 
holds a temporary safe haven visa; or 

(b) 
has not left Australia since ceasing to hold a temporary safe haven visa. 

(2) 
This Subdivision does not apply to an unauthorised maritime arrival or a transitory person.
